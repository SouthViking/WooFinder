### ❓ What is WooFinder? 

People like to have pets, but saddendly, sometimes pets can get lost. You would usually place posters near to the location where they get lost to try to catch the interest of other people... but why not taking advantage of the technology?
**WooFinder** is a Telegram Bot that allows you to register your pets and generate reports in case they get lost, so other people can use the bot to find reports that are near their location.

Specifically, with **WooFinder** you will be able to:

* 🐾 Register/update/remove pets.
<br>

* 🔎 Register/update/remove lost pet reports.
<br>

* 📍 Get a list of lost pet reports that are near to a provided location.
<br>

* 🔔 Send a notification to the owner/s with your contact data, whenever you find/see a lost pet.

### 🤖 Bot commands

There are 2 commands that will display all the available options. Each time you select one of the options, a conversation will start and other commands won't be executed, unless you send the **"exit"** keyword to the bot.

* **/pets** → Displays the pet's menu with the following options:
